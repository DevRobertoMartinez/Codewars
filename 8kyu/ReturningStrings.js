/* Description:
     # Returning Strings
     
     Create a function that accepts a parameter representing a name and returns the message: "Hello, <name> how are you doing today?".

     [Make sure you type the exact thing I wrote or the program may not execute properly]

/* Sample function: 
     function name(){

     } 
*/

/*   # Intuition
     My initial thoughts are to... 
     just use string interpolation
*/

//   # Code
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name} how are you doing today?`;
}
